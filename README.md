# 🎓 Campus Placement Prediction System

An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts whether a student will get placed or not based on academic and demographic information.  
The model is trained using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and deployed as a web application using Streamlit.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data Collection
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
3. One-Hot Encoding of categorical features
4. Feature Scaling
5. Model Training & Evaluation
6. Model Comparison (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM)
7. Final Model Selection (SVM)
8. Model Saving using Pickle
9. Deployment using Streamlit
